# Raptcha

A simple clientside captcha. You style your elements and you handle the form submission. This just provides the tools to make sure your user isn't an evil robot.

 - Uses a challenge image and an input.
 - Checks for mouse and input events.
 - Checks for brute force attempts (allows 10 tries).
 - Checks user agent for some keywords.

This won't stop a sophisticated bot, but it's free, easy to use, and doens't require a Google API key.

See the index.html for an example.
